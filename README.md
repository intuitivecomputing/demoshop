## Introduction
This repository accompanies the paper [*Designing User-Centric Programming Aids for Kinesthetic Teaching of Collaborative Robots*](https://intuitivecomputing.jhu.edu/publications/2021-ras-ajaykumar.pdf). It contains the source code for Demoshop, an interactive robot programming tool that includes user-centric programming aids to help end-users author and edit task demonstration. Demoshop consists of front-end software that runs on the [Unity game engine](https://unity.com/) and back-end software that runs on Ubuntu using [ROS](https://www.ros.org/).
